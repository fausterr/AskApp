# General info

The aim of the project was to create a page where users can ask questions. The visual side of the site does not look appealing, because the use of css was just an addition.
This page includes:
* user registration and login
* creating posts
* Posts can be sorted by category
* Users can add comments under the post and rate with thumbs up or down
* list of people who posted the most posts
* Posts can be added to favorites, which are then displayed on the user's profile.

# Technologies

* Java
* Jakarta EE
* MySQL
* HTML & CSS
